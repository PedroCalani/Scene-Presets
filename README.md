# Scene-Presets

This is a Houdini Shelf tool to save and load some presets/templates to speed up the start of any new project.

#### How to install:
1) Download scene_presets.shelf and copy it to your houdini toolbar folder. This will usually be in "C:\Users\NAME\Documents\houdini20.0\toolbar".
2) In houdini you have to add the shelf to your workspace.

#### Attention:
All saved pressets will be stored as .cmd files in your path “HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR/scene_pressets” which will usually be "C:\Users\NAME\Documents\houdini20.0\scene_presets".

The tool has some limitations for saving custom HDA, although with the standard nodes it works fine.
